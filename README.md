## Getting Started

Sign up for a free Developer Account at <a href="https://voiceit.io/signup" target="_blank">VoiceIt.io</a> and view your API Key and Token in the settings page(as shown below). You can also review the HTTP Documentation at <a href="https://api.voiceit.io" target="_blank">api.voiceit.io</a>.

<img src="Graphics/devSettings.png" alt="API Key and Token" width="400px" />

## Requirements

minSdkVersion: 17

## Installation

VoiceItApi2AndroidSDK is available through [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#voiceittech/VoiceItApi2AndroidSDK/).

## API Calls

### Initialization

First import *VoiceItAPI2* and then initialize a reference to the SDK inside an Activity, passing in your API Credentials or user token.

```java
import com.loopj.android.http.JsonHttpResponseHandler;
import cz.msebera.android.httpclient.Header;
import org.json.JSONObject;

import com.voiceit.voiceit2.VoiceItAPI2;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private VoiceItAPI2 myVoiceIt;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        // If using user tokens, replace API_KEY below with the user token,
        // and leave the second argument as an empty string
        myVoiceIt = new VoiceItAPI2("API_KEY","API_TOK");
    }
}
```

### API calls

For each API call, a JsonHttpResponseHandler is needed to receive the result of the call. You can override the response handlers like so, and abbreviated with ellipses below:
```java
new JsonHttpResponseHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(int statusCode, Header[] headers, JSONObject response) {
        System.out.println("JSONResult : " + response.toString());
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(int statusCode, Header[] headers, Throwable throwable, JSONObject errorResponse) {
        if (errorResponse != null) {
            System.out.println("JSONResult : " + errorResponse.toString());
        }
    }
});
```

### Liveness Detection

For our Encapsulated Face and Video Verification methods, liveness detection can be enabled with a passed in boolean parameter. 
This enables a a pre-check(prompting to the user to turn their head or smile) before the verification API call to decrease the chance the user is able to spoof with a photo of someone else.

### Encapsulated Methods

Methods that take care of all the logic of enrollment and verification, and the UI in new Android Activities.
Immediately upon calling a method it displays a enrollment/verification view controller that enrolls/verifies the user and 
provides relevant callbacks for whether the API calls were successful or not with associated biometric confidence.
Note: If less than the required enrollments exist for a user, enrollment methods delete them and re-enroll.
